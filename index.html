    An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines
    beaten eggs cooked to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of
    cheese, vegetables, or meats. Preparation time Total: Approximately 10
    minutes Preparation: 5 minutes Cooking: 5 minutes Ingredients 2-3 large eggs
    Salt, to taste Pepper, to taste 1 tablespoon of butter or oil Optional
    fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs Instructions Beat
    the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until
    they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a
    fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium
    heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and
    bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the
    surface. Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges
    but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings
    over one half of the omelette. Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to
    cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for
    another minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy: Serve hot, with
    additional salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition The table below shows
    nutritional values per serving without the additional fillings. Calories
